      <p class="col-6" >Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale, with
           a strong priority placed on speed of service. Fast food is a commercial term, limited to 
           food sold in a restaurant or store with frozen, preheated or precooked ingredients and served in
            packaging for take-out or takeaway. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to accommodate 
            large numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage workers. In 2018, the fast-food industry was worth
             an estimated $570 billion globally.[1]Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale, with
